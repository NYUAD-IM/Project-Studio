Course Description
------------------

This 2-unit 7-week Directed Study course will provide students with an environment to work on an interactive media project that may fall outside the scope of currently offered classes. The course will offer the necessary structure and timeline to complete a single project as well as the opportunity for peer learning. Appropriate projects lie in the area of web-based applications, trans-media narratives, virtual reality experiences, and interactive art installations. A project may be an entirely new idea or it may be an existing project that reqires more time and effort. Students may work independently or in teams.

Class will meet weekly for 3 hours. Each week students will fulfill assignment deadlines and post their progress online. During classtime, students are expected to share project development, obtain critique, and offer critique. Guests will be invited to offer feedback and advice in one-on-one sessions and in a group setting. The course will culminate with a final project presentation open to the entire NYUAD community.

Grading
-------
10% - Attendance
10% - Participation
20% - Weekly Assignments
20% - Mid-Term (Week 4) Project
40% - Final Project

Attendance & Participation
--------------------------
Students are expected to attend ALL classes. More than 1 unexcused absence is grounds for failing the class.
In class, students are required to share work, offer feedback to fellow students, and present their final project at the end-of-term show. A failure to participate in these activitie is grounds for failing the class.

Weekly Assignments
------------------
Each week, there will be an assignment that demonstrates iterative development of the student's individual project. The intent is that each week's work will build on the preceeding week and culminate in one large final project.

Mid-Term
--------
Students are required to build a "user-testable" version of their project by Week 4. Outside guests will join class to interact with the projects and provide independent feedback. A successful mid-term project will be a functional version of the project that has a clear set of testable objectives.  A written analysis of the test results will also be required. 

Final Project
-------------
At the end of the 7 weeks, each student will be required to publicly present their work. The final project is expected to demonstrate a working proof of concept. The final project will be evaluated based on:
* the student's initial projects brief
* weekly assignment updates and progress
* the mid-term project results
